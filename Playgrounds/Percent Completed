var percentCompleted: Double = 0.0

//:  Imagine that partway through the day a user has taken 3,467 steps out of the 10,000 step goal. This means he/she is 34.67% of the way to his/her goal. Assign 34.67 to `percentCompleted`. Does the code compile? Go back and explicity assign a type to `percentCompleted` that will allow the code to compile.
percentCompleted = 34.67
